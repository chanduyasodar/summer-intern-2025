**Date:** Summer 2025

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the expression and purification of three disulfide-rich scorpion toxins targeting voltage-gated sodium channels: **Bmk M1**, **Lqq4**, and **LqhaIT Mutant (Y11S)**[cite: 939, 975]. [cite_start]The study aims to isolate these peptides for structural and functional analysis[cite: 976].

## Methodology
**Cloning & Expression**
* **Vector:** `pET21a(+)` with 6-His and Cytochrome $b_5$ tags.
* **Host:** *E. coli* BL21(DE3), induced with IPTG at $20^{\circ}C$.

**Purification Pipeline**
1. **Lysis:** French Press homogenization.
2. **Affinity:** Ni-NTA chromatography to capture His-tagged proteins.
3. **Cleavage:** Thrombin digestion to remove fusion tags.
4. **Polishing:** Size Exclusion (Superdex-30) followed by Reverse Phase HPLC (C18).
5. **Isolation:** Lyophilization of pure fractions.

## Key Results
* **Expression:** Successful transformation and induction confirmed via SDS-PAGE.
* **Purification:** High-purity isolation achieved via multi-step chromatography.
* **Validation:** MALDI-MS for **Lqq4** showed a mass of **7470.46 Da** (Expected: 7469.53 Da), confirming successful purification[cite: 1603, 1610].

## Tools Used
* **Techniques:** HPLC, MALDI-TOF MS, SEC, Affinity Chromatography.
* **Software:** SnapGene.
